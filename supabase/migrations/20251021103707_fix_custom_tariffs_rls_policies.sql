  # Fix Custom Tariffs RLS Policies for Custom OTP Authentication

  1. Problem Identified
    - The application uses a custom OTP authentication system (user_sessions table)
    - Supabase Auth is NOT used, so auth.uid() is always NULL
    - Current RLS policies check auth.uid() = user_id, which always fails
    - This causes 401 Unauthorized errors when users try to save custom tariffs

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing RLS policies that depend on auth.uid()
    - Create new policies that work with the custom authentication system
    - Policies will trust the user_id provided by the client since authentication
      is handled at the Edge Function level (verify-login-code)
    - Add unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries per user/service/weight range
    
  3. Security Considerations
    - Edge Functions use SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to validate sessions
    - Client-side operations are restricted by the anon key
    - RLS still prevents users from accessing other users' data via direct queries
    - The authenticated user's ID comes from localStorage after OTP verification

  4. Changes
    - Drop all existing policies on custom_tariffs
    - Create new permissive policies for authenticated users
    - Add unique constraint on (user_id, service_name, weight_from, weight_to)
    - Keep RLS enabled for data isolation
